description: "As a Mechanical Engineer with an industry-trained background in software development, I pretty much have no idea what I'm doing with my life. I'm Lead Engineer for a social impact startup, I do freelance engineering and design work, and I'm nearly finished with my Masters degree, focused in Design Engineering. My pursuits have led to many interesting experiences, and whether they were great successes or massive failures, I came out of each more learned than before. I find myself now with an abundance of skills, and though I don't yet know how they will culminate, I find some comfort in the wisdom it provides me. Let this website serve as a portfolio for all my projects, and hopefully inspire some direction for my professional career."
